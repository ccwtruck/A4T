<br/> 
After the last year or two looking after Xol and transforming it into Xol Toolhead, I thought it was about time I tried to see if I could design something from scratch. The result is A4T: [A]nother [4]010 [T]oolhead <br/><br/>

A4T is built around the following constraints:
* Dual 4010 blower fans for part cooling
* HF and some UHF hotends (originally designed around Dragon HF with an extender).
* 2510 hotend cooling with well-directed hotend cooling airflow. (Can't beat the amazing 5v Delta 2510)
* ***Easy Assembly***
* Custom Wrist Watch BMG mod with Sherpa-Mini spacing. Also works with Sherpa-Mini. (Some WWG2 and oribter options now too)
* Neopixel LEDs with good part lighting from in front of the nozzle.
* Built for Xol-Carriage - can work with Voron Tap / Standard Voron CW2 carriage.

> [!TIP] 
> ### NEW: Crossbow Filament Cutter And EMU MMU<br/>
> Make A4T part of a complete MMU system with the [Crossbow Filament Cutter](https://github.com/DW-Tas/Crossbow-Filament-Cutter) and [EMU](https://github.com/DW-Tas/EMU)<br/>

## Pre-requisites
A printer that fits either Xol carriage, or a standard voron CW2 or Tap carriage. `NOT cartographer CNC carriage (see warning below)`<br/>
<br/>
To avoid build plate area loss:
- X/Y gantry joints that are within the same size as standard Voron 2.4 or Trident X/Y joints.
- Slimmer than stock idlers (see warning below) 

See Voron Design instructions to install TAP.<br/>
`If using tap, highly recommended to replace M3x50 SHCS with button head screws for better build plate clearance.`<br/>

> [!NOTE] 
> ### Notes for Xol-Carriage<br/>
> * Xol-Carriage documentation is here: https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead/blob/main/docs/xol_carriage_assembly.md<br/>
> * A4T uses standard length probe modules for Xol-Carriage (even with UHF hotends in A4T).<br/>
> * Monolith Gantry users should go with the Monolith specific Xol-Carriage mod: [Monolith_Xol-Carriage](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Armchair-Usermods/tree/main/files/Xol-Toolhead/Monolith_Xol-Carriage)<br/>

<br/><br/>

> [!WARNING]
> ### Front Idlers  
> A4T can collide with the stock voron front idlers for Trident and 2.4 when the toolhead is in the front corners of the build area. This can cause issues with the homing sequence when homing X if the toolhead is at the front of the gantry on Y. <br/><br/>
> Fully compatible idlers:<br/>
> * clee's [BFI (Beefy Front Idlers)](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI)  <br/>
> * Ramalama2's [Front Idlers](https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers)  

<br/><br/>

> [!WARNING]
> ### Cartographer CNC carriage  
> <img src='docs/images/NoCncCartoCarriage.png' width=50 align='left'> The Cartographer CNC carriage is made for StealthBurner, not A4T. The probe will sit too low if used with A4T unless you have the tools and skill necessary to remove ~1.8mm off the bottom of the Cartographer CNC carriage mounting points where the probe attaches.

## Printing parts

> [!TIP] 
> ### Printed Parts Configurator<br/>
> <img src='docs/images/configurator.png' width=200><br>
> A great way to understand which files to print is by using the configurator at <a href="https://a4t.dwtas.net/">https://a4t.dwtas.net/</a><br><br>
> That configurator is new and not heavily tested, if you have issues, there is this original configurator by <a href="https://github.com/Corunir">Corunir</a>: <a href="https://a4t.wizards-enclave.net/">https://a4t.wizards-enclave.net/</a>

### Print settings
Parts are meant to be printed in 0.2mm layer heights, 0.25mm first layer should be OK. Other layer heights will cause the built-in supports to fail or fuse to the printed part.<br/>
Print settings will depend on your printer setup / filament used / phase of the moon/etc.<br/>
The parts are not pre-scaled for any particular filament type. You will need to tune the filament you use for correct shrinkage compensation to get good results. Development was done with multiple brands of ASA and ASA-CF filaments (each individually tuned).<br/>

General voron-like settings are a good starting point for 0.4mm wall widths (four walls, 5 top/bottom layers and 40% infill).<br/>
The print setup was tested with 0.5mm nozzle printing 0.55mm line widths with 3 walls and 40% infill with good results.<br/>

You're printing a toolhead, not a trinket or a toy. You should be aiming for high strength with strong layer adhesion. I.e. print it slower/hotter if you have bad layer adhesion. It doesn't matter if it takes over 2 hours to print the main body.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

> [!WARNING]
> ### Blower fan fit  
> `If your blower fans are not a slight friction fit, you likely had shrinkage compensation or EM issues. You can probably get away with using some masking tape on top of a loose fan to save a reprint in a pinch.` <br/>
> <br/>
> Fans should go in with a slight friction fit. DO NOT FORCE THEM IN. Your print settings aren't right if the fans are too tight. More shrinkage compensation or less EM depending on if you're over extruding or not.

### The Results
After six months of development, CAD, CFD, trial and lots of error. Finally, A4T has better IS results, better cooling results and a new look compared to what I have been doing the last few years.

This is a comparison of part cooling between Xol and A4T. 
These prints were completed on the same printer, with the same gcode, same filament, the same hotend and part cooling fans (~~inserts~~ ***backflow inhibitors*** installed for A4T test).

### License clarification regarding non-commercial use:
The non-commercial aspect of this license is for cases where A4T is the product, not the use of A4T to create products.<br/>
I.e. If you wish to sell A4T as a product, you would need to seek a commercial license before doing so. </br>
It is NOT intended to prevent the use of A4T in a printer that you use to provide commercial services. If you want to run A4T as a toolhead for your print farm printers, go right ahead.
